# Introduction to React.

## What is React?.
React as the docs says is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Why learning React?
### Declarative
React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each
state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
right components when your data changes.

Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
In addition, React declarative nature make it very easy, in sense that, you just tell
it what you want and React will effectively do the hard work for you.

### Component-Based
Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data
through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
